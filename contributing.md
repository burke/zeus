# Reporting issues

I'd love it if you could use this template for bug reports, but it's not
necessary:

```
## Description of Problem

One or two sentences giving an overview of the issue.

## System details

* **`uname -a`**:

* **`ruby -v`**:

* **`go version`**: (only if hacking on the go code)

## Steps to Reproduce

1) `zeus start` in a new rails project

2) `zeus ponies`

## Observed Behavior

* Ponies die

## Expected Behavior

* Ponies survive
```

# Hacking on Zeus

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you can get started, you'll need to install ruby 1.9+, Go (golang) 1.1+,
and make.

On OS X, you'll only need to install Go.

## Step 2: Paths, etc.

You should check out this repository into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/burke/zeus`.
Often `$GOPATH` will be set to `~/go`, but this is configurable. If you've just
installed Go, you'll have to set this up yourself in your shell config. The Go
site [has documentation on this](http://golang.org/doc/code.html).

## Step 3: Dependencies

cd into the zeus project directory and run `make`. This will fetch and
compile a couple libraries zeus uses for terminal interaction and such.
Read through that last chunk of the `Makefile` to understand what's
going on.

Of particular interest is [`gox`](http://github.com/mitchellh/gox), which we
use to crosscompile multiple binaries.

## Step 4: Building

### Context: How zeus is structured

The core of zeus is a single go program that acts as the coordinating process
(coordinator, e.g. `zeus start`), or the client (called per-command, e.g. `zeus
client`). This code is cross-compiled for a handful of different architectures
and bundled with a ruby gem. The ruby gem contains all the shim code necessary
to boot a rails app under the control of the coordinator process.

### Building

Just run `make`, which would build the go binaries to `./build`
directory. This step might take some time to complete.

## Releasing

Be aware that all release builts should be done on MacOSX to include the
binaries for MacOSX in the gem, when built on Linux only the linux binaries will
be included and therefor zeus will not work on linux.

* Build via normal `make`, this puts the build gem on in `rubygem/pkg/zeus-<VERSION>.gem`
* With access to rubygems run `gem push rubygem/pkg/zeus-<VERSION>.gem`

## Step 5: Contributing

Fork, branch, pullrequest! I'm sometimes really bad about responding to these
in a timely fashion. Feel free to harass me on email or twitter if I'm not
getting back to you.

## Questions?

If this doesn't work out for you, hit me up on twitter at @burkelibbey or email
at burke@libbey.me, or maybe @ischi on twitter can help as well.
